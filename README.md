# PokéDB
A Simple, Online Pokemon Database

### Features
[PokéDB](http://kurisubrooks.github.io/pokedb/) shows you basic information on every Pokémon, while keeping a clean, minimalistic design.

### Contributions
For now, we won't be accepting Pull Requests, unless they add vital features or important bug fixes.
Instead of helping us, please, instead go and help [PokéAPI](https://github.com/phalt/pokeapi). The original creator is unable to find time to keep it updated, and has open-sourced the code so users can help contribute. 

### IRC
Got IRC? Great, so do we! Pop into **#pokedb** on **irc.esper.net** and come have a chat!
